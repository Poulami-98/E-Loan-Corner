<h1><font color="red">  Car Loan <span><i></i></span> </font></h1>
<p>A car loan (also known as an automobile loan, or auto loan) is a sum of money a consumer borrows in order to purchase a car. Generally speaking a
 loan is an amount of money that is lent to an individual, a business, or another entity. The party that lends the money is known as the lender, 
 while the party borrowing the money is called the borrower. When taking out a loan a borrower agrees to pay back the full loan amount, as well as 
 any interest (a percentage of the loan amount, usually calculated on an annual basis), by a certain date, typically by making monthly payments.</p>
